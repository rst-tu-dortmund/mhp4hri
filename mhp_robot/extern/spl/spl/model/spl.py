Structured prediction layer (SPL).

Given a context (i.e., rnn hidden state or something similar), implements pose prediction hierarchically by following
the skeletal structure. `build` method implements the operations in TF graph.

Skeletal structure for full-body human pose is defined below. Similarly, you can introduce a new skeleton configuration.
